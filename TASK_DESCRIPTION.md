# I am creating a 3D floor plan modeling web application

- Curently the project is initialized with a rectangle box (walls). I want to have an interior wall that is inside the box.
- Interior wall width is 150mm. It should move with keyboard keys as exterior walls.
- Interior wall should split exteriors wall that is attached to it in 3 segments - left, middle and right. Middle segment should be 150mm wide (interior wall width).
